2	36	So, we used to solve big problems.
37	151	On July 21st, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
152	286	Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
287	382	The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States.
383	497	To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget.
498	625	Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
626	670	People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
671	732	But before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon.
733	846	Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin, following the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most senior.
847	1009	They did not bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks, and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home.
1010	1134	The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
1135	1209	But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue.
1210	1316	John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, And they may well ask, Why, 35 years ago, We choose to go to the moon.
1317	1346	We choose to go to the moon.
1347	1469	We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
1470	1567	Jason Pontin: To contemporaries, Apollo was not only a victory of West over East in the Cold War.
1568	1658	At the time, the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology.
1659	1702	They went because it was a big thing to do.
1703	1790	Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs.
1791	1913	The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
1914	1995	In the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
1996	2088	Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in 1970 called "accelerative thrust."
2089	2238	For most of human history, we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
2239	2294	Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon.
2295	2584	No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard.
2585	2630	I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
2631	2730	I was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
2731	2865	I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions, but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime.
2866	2969	So "Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology" has become a commonplace.
2970	2995	You hear it all the time.
2996	3048	We have heard it over the last two days here at TED.
3049	3233	It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed automated trading.
3234	3282	There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
3283	3325	They have expanded and enriched our lives.
3326	3372	But they do not solve humanity's big problems.
3373	3571	So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley, which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
3572	3695	Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame, in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
3696	3851	Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems.
3852	3903	But I do not think that explanation is good enough.
3904	3956	It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
3957	4106	Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
4107	4404	V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy, and V.C.s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value.
4405	4490	No, the reasons we can not solve big problems are more complicated and more profound.
4491	4537	Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
4538	4569	We could go to Mars if we want.
4570	4606	NASA even has the outline of a plan.
4607	4707	But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal, and that will never happen.
4708	4808	We will not go to Mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth.
4809	4885	Sometimes, we can not solve big problems because our political systems fail.
4886	5081	Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced, renewable sources such as solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is purely economic.
5082	5175	Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
5176	5237	We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price.
5238	5249	None exist.
5250	5525	Now, technologists, business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on carbon.
5526	5669	But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
5670	5746	Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so.
5747	5816	Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply.
5817	5938	But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution.
5939	6095	Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food, but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
6096	6191	Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution because we do not really understand the problem.
6192	6433	President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, viable therapies have come to seem real.
6434	6457	Hard problems are hard.
6458	6526	It's not true that we can not solve big problems through technology.
6527	6761	We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it.
6762	6886	The Apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems, met these criteria.
6887	6936	But it is an irreproducible model for the future.
6937	6952	It is not 1961.
6953	7163	There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system.
7164	7217	Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy.
7218	7246	It was just three days away.
7247	7302	And arguably it was not even solving much of a problem.
7303	7386	We are left alone with our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
7387	7432	God knows, we do not lack for the challenges.
7433	7453	Thank you very much.
