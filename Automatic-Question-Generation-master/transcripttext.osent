2	117	So infectious diseases, Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world.
118	240	Every year, millions of people die of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV, around the world and even in the United States.
241	296	Every year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.
297	336	Now of course, humans, we are creative.
337	407	We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases.
408	435	We have drugs and vaccines.
436	526	And we are conscious -- we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions.
527	593	We used to think we are alone in this, but now we know we are not.
594	630	We are not the only medical doctors.
631	702	Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too.
703	737	Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
738	825	Not so much different from us, they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.
826	948	But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too: elephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.
949	1108	And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too.
1109	1273	The problem with infectious diseases, as we all know, is that pathogens continue to evolve, and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy.
1274	1386	And therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases.
1387	1495	Now, I think that we should look at these animals, and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.
1496	1575	As a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.
1576	1775	Now, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year, where millions of them come together, but it's not why I started studying them.
1776	1815	I study monarchs because they get sick.
1816	1839	They get sick like you.
1840	1862	They get sick like me.
1863	1949	And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans.
1950	2054	Now, the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful.
2055	2214	What they do is they produce spores, millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.
2215	2261	And this is really detrimental to the monarch.
2262	2373	It shortens their lifespan, it reduces their ability to fly, it can even kill them before they are even adults.
2374	2400	Very detrimental parasite.
2401	2544	As part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants, and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.
2545	2578	They only eat milkweed as larvae.
2579	2695	Luckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use, and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them.
2696	2731	These are chemicals that are toxic.
2732	2784	They are toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.
2785	2921	In fact, monarchs can take up the chemicals, put it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic against their predators, such as birds.
2922	3051	And what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange, black and white.
3052	3150	So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse, different ones, different milkweeds.
3151	3253	Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed, with very high concentrations of these cardenolides.
3254	3278	And some were not toxic.
3279	3311	And then I fed them to monarchs.
3312	3346	Some of the monarchs were healthy.
3347	3367	They had no disease.
3368	3638	But some of the monarchs were sick, and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies, meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants.
3639	3783	And when I found this, I had this idea, and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea, but I thought, So my team and I started doing experiments.
3784	3913	In the first types of experiments, we had caterpillars, and gave them a choice: medicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed.
3914	3989	And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.
3990	4084	And the result, as so often in science, was boring: Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.
4085	4107	Fifty percent was not.
4108	4169	These caterpillars did not do anything for their own welfare.
4170	4306	So then we moved on to adult butterflies, and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.
4307	4394	We have done these experiments now over several years, and always get the same results.
4395	4588	What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage, a medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side, and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.
4589	4641	And what we find when we do that is always the same.
4642	4715	What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.
4716	4831	In other words, what these females are doing is they are laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
4832	4929	Intriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they are laying the eggs.
4930	4955	They cannot prevent this.
4956	4994	They can also not medicate themselves.
4995	5158	But what these experiments tell us is that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick.
5159	5347	Now, this is a really important discovery, I think, not just because it tells us something cool about nature, but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.
5348	5435	Now, these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple.
5436	5517	They have tiny little brains, yet they can do this very sophisticated medication.
5518	5702	Now, we know that even today, most of our drugs derive from natural products, including plants, and in indigenous cultures, traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.
5703	5828	In this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset, and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.
5829	6049	What I think is important, though, is to move beyond these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit, these simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of as very, very simple with tiny little brains.
6050	6319	The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues, and I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies, and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.
6320	6338	Thank you so much.
