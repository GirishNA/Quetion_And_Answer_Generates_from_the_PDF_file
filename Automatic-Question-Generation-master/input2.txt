Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky, to Thomas and Nancy Lincoln in their one room
log cabin on their farm known as Sinking Spring (near modern-day Hodgenville, Kentucky). Although Thomas lacked formal
education, he was an excellent farmer and carpenter, and often times served as a member of the jury. Thomas and Nancy
joined a small Baptist church in the area that had broken away from the larger church over the issue of slavery.
When Abe was two, the family moved to nearby Knob Creek Farm where Abe's first memories of his childhood were formed.
Because of difficulties his father had with the title to the farm, Thomas Lincoln moved his family to Pigeon Creek, Indiana in
1816 where the seven year-old Abraham helped him build a log cabin in the woods. Two years later, Nancy died of “milk
sickness.” Milk sickness is a rare disease caused by drinking the milk or consuming the meat of a cow that had fed on
poisonous roots. In 1819, however, Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston, whom Abraham would call “mother.” Sarah was a
kind and warm women who brought her three children, Matilda, Elizabeth, and John to the Lincoln homestead to live with
Abraham and his sister.
