So what the speaker did during his job was grow plants in the greenhouse, different ones, different milkweeds.Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed, with very high concentrations of these cardenolides.And some were not toxic.And then the speaker fed them to monarchs.Some of the monarchs were healthy.They had no disease.But some of the monarchs were sick, and what the speaker found was that some of these milkweeds were medicinal, meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies, meaning these monarchs can live longer when they were infected when feeding on these medicinal plants.
